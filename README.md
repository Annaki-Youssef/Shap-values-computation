# About
In this repository, I implement three different Shapley values computation methods. I do the comparison between the Uniform sampling method and the Structured sampling method to compute this values. Concerning the third approach, I based my work on the Multilinear Extension of the Shapley values proposed by Owen [1]. This last approach will be used to infere memory properties of financial time series (CAC40 data) from forecasting explainability.
